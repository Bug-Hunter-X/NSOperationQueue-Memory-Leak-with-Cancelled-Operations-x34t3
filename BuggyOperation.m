In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSOperationQueue` and its interaction with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).  Consider a scenario where an `NSOperation` object holds a strong reference to a significant object, let's say a large image. If this operation is added to the queue and then cancelled before it completes, the operation object will not automatically deallocate until its execution completes.  If many such operations are cancelled, substantial memory can be retained, causing performance degradation or crashes. This is especially critical in situations with many long-running or complex operations.
